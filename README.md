I assumed the role of a data analyst at Yemyem supermarket. The managing director requested a visualization of the sales in the year 2018 as he was not around to monitor the sales. He specified the key things he wanted from the visualization;

The product that was sold the most 
The product with the highest profit
The time with the most sales
The day and month with the highest sales
The login type that was most used to purchase products
Product category with the highest sales
Which type of customer purchases the most
The payment method that was most used
The gender that purchased products the most.
He would also love an insight from you as the data analyst on how to improve the sales and efficiency of the company.
