# Nithub-Capstone-Project-in-Excel

I assumed the role of a data analyst at Yemyem supermarket. The managing director requested a visualization of the sales in the year 2018 as he was not around to monitor the sales. He specified the key things he wanted from the visualization;

The product that was sold the most 

The product with the highest profit

The time with the most sales

The day and month with the highest sales

The login type that was most used to purchase products

Product category with the highest sales

Which type of customer purchases the most

The payment method that was most used

The gender that purchased products the most.

He would also love an insight from you as the data analyst on how to improve the sales and efficiency of the company.


**I used a pivot table and a pivot chart to analyze the key things the managing director wanted. Also, based on the key findings I came up with insights on how to improve sales and efficiency of the company.**

The files in this repository are:

excel workbook that contains the raw data, cleaned data, pivot table, and an interactive dashboard.

Documentation process in Word.
